    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Soup:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken (about 4 pounds)</li>
        <li>8 cups water</li>
        <li>2 onions, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>4 carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>4 celery stalks, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Noodles:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the whole chicken, water, onions, carrots, celery, garlic, bay leaves, dried thyme, salt, and pepper in a large stockpot.</li>
        <li>Bring the pot to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the pot and set it aside to cool slightly. Once cooled, shred the chicken meat discarding the skin and bones.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooling, prepare the noodles. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, eggs, salt, and enough water to form a dough. Knead the dough on a floured surface until it's smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/8 inch and cut it into thin strips to make your noodles. Set them aside to dry for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring the chicken broth in the pot back to a gentle simmer and add the homemade noodles. Cook for about 10-12 minutes until the noodles are tender.</li>
        <li>Return the shredded chicken to the pot and let it simmer for another 5-10 minutes to heat through.</li>
        <li>Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.</li>
    </ol>
